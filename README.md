# Tiny Pong
Tiny Pong for micro:bit-v2

## Status

Currently the game is a human player against a naive computer opponent.
- Human player starts with the ball, whoever scores a point gets to launch the ball next
- Computer paddle bounds from side to side without consideration for ball location
- Game ends when either player accumulates 5 points, and point counts are displayed one row out from each player's paddle

## To Do

- Computer strategy (follow ball trajectory)
- Mode for 2 human players
- Menu to select 1 or 2 human players
- Opening splash animation
- Fade from Menu to game
- Option to play again? (maintain win count across games?)
